# Irrigation System App


This is an irrigation scheduling system that automate the scheduling of land irrigation base on timeslot and amount of water configuration 



## Instructions

To compile (also runs unit tests)

```
mvn package
```

## Dependencies
```
The system make use of MySql database as such an isntance of mysql database is required to run the application so ensure the application.properties configuration is updated with database configuration before running the application
```
The mail server configuration needs to be updated to send alert to system admin when irrigation controller service is not available


## To run the app 

```
mvn spring-boot:run
```

....and navigate your browser to  http://localhost:8080/

To  add land post request to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/land

    "area": 2000,
    "landType": "Sandy",
    "agricType": "Rice farming"
}
```

To  edit land put request to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/land/{landId}

```JSON
{
    "code": "29388933",
    "area": 2000,
    "landType": "Clay Soil",
    "agricType": "Rice farming"
}
```

To  edit configure land post request to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/land/{landId}/configure

```JSON
{
    "deviceName": "Sensie153",
    "timeSlot":"2022-08-10T22:09:32.000+00:00",
    "durationInMinutes": 3600,
    "intervalInDays": 4,
    "amountOfWater": 2000
}
```

To  get land details navigate to http://localhost:8080/api/v1/land/

        "landConfigurations": []
    }
]
```
## How it works
```
After setting up the land and land configuration a task scheduler is run every seconds to check the 
land that is due for irrigation base on nextTimeSlot column in the land configuration table if found, the nextTimeSlot field is updated base on the intervalInDays value. 

Then irrigation schedule is created and executed by sending a request to Iot device to perform the irrigation using the IoTDeviceControllerService a mock implementation as been added to the solution to return random status of SUCCESSFUL,FAILED or NOTAVAILABLE.

If the service returns NOTAVAILABLE the service is retried until the allowed number of retries is exceed, if the status is still NOTAVAILABE then an  alert is sent to the admin to notify the admin of the service unavailability.  

```
## To run integration tests

```
mvn spring-boot:run
mvn verify
```

## Run all the unit test.
$ mvn test


Enjoy!
